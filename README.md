# Deployment

‚ö†Ô∏èüîÆ _need to work on a smoother flow here, but this is working_

1. Build tarball (distillery release) in Docker container

   ```
   docker build ./ -t mr-build -f Dockerfile.build
   ```

1. Create a container of that build (not sure this is exactly what this step does...) which will spit out a long hash string [HASH]

   ```
   docker create mr-build:latest
   ```

1. copy stuff from container to host filesystem

   ```
   docker cp [HASH]:app/\_build ./dump
   ```

1. Manually go into finder and move `./dump/_build/prod/rel/mr/bin` and `./dump/_build/prod/rel/mr/releases/0.0.1/mr.tar.gz` to the root this directory

1. Deploy to now, which uses `Dockerfile`

   ```
   now
   ```

1. Do aliasing.
